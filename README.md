# NeRF-megengine

This is an implementation of [NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) for [MegEngine](https://github.com/MegEngine/MegEngine).

[NeRF](http://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) (Neural Radiance Fields) is a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes. Here are some videos generated by this repository (pre-trained models are provided below):

This project is a faithful MegEnengine implementation of NeRF. The code is based on authors' Tensorflow implementation [here](https://github.com/bmild/nerf) and Pytorch implemention [here](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch) by [Yen-Chen Lin](https://github.com/yenchenlin).

If you meet any problems when using this repo, please feel free to contact [FateScript](https://github.com/FateScript) @ [Megvii](https://megvii.com/).

## Installation

It's recommended to use venv to train your NeRF model.

A simple venv command example:
```bash
python3 -m venv nerf_mge
source nerf_mge/bin/activate
```

```
git clone https://github.com/MegEngine/NeRF.git
cd nerf
python3 -m pip -v -e .
```
The LLFF data loader requires ImageMagick.

You will also need the [LLFF code](http://github.com/fyusion/llff) (and COLMAP) set up to compute poses if you want to run on your own real data.

## How To Run?

### Quick Start

Download data for two example datasets: `lego` and `fern`
```
bash download_example_data.sh
```

To train a low-res `lego` NeRF:
```
python3 run.py --config configs/lego.txt
```
After training for 100k iterations (~8 hours on a single 2080 Ti), you can find the following video at `logs/lego_test/lego_test_spiral_100000_rgb.mp4`.

To train a low-res `fern` NeRF:
```
python run.py --config configs/fern.txt
```
After training for 200k iterations (~8 hours on a single 2080 Ti), you can find the following video at `logs/fern_test/fern_test_spiral_200000_rgb.mp4` and `logs/fern_test/fern_test_spiral_200000_disp.mp4`

To train NeRF on different datasets: 

```
python run.py --config configs/{DATASET}.txt
```

replace `{DATASET}` with `trex` | `horns` | `flower` | `fortress` | `lego` | etc.

---

To test NeRF trained on different datasets: 

```
python run.py --config configs/{DATASET}.txt --render_only
```

replace `{DATASET}` with `trex` | `horns` | `flower` | `fortress` | `lego` | etc.

> A neural radiance field is a simple fully connected network (weights are ~5MB) trained to reproduce input views of a single scene using a rendering loss. The network directly maps from spatial location and viewing direction (5D input) to color and opacity (4D output), acting as the "volume" so we can use volume rendering to differentiably render new views

## Known issue
* Some operators is not supported well in MegEngine, I work around this issue by using operator writing in Python, this might cause NeRF-megengine runs slower.
